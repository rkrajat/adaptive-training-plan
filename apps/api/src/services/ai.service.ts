- Injury prevention
- Progressive overload principles

   - Overall training volume and consistency
   - Notable patterns (e.g., increasing/decreasing mileage, pace trends)
   - Heart rate insights if available

2. **Recommended Adjustments** (3-4 specific bullet points):
   - Weekly mileage recommendations
   - Workout type suggestions (easy runs, tempo, intervals, long run)
   - Recovery considerations
   - Any cautionary notes about overtraining or undertraining

Keep the tone professional but encouraging. Be specific and actionable.`;
